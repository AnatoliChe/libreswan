IKEv2 TCP with truncated initial packet + close

West sends an incomplete IKETCP request and then closes the outgoing
stream.  Pluto (east), or the kernel, is expected to detect this and
close the TCP stream.  When this happens reading the ready socket
returns 0 bytes (aka EOF).

Note that early kernels would instead returning EAGAIN (a good sign of
this bug is a log file full of EAGAIN errors).
