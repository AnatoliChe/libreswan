Test IKEv2 with addresspool and DNS CP payloads

Do an --up, followed by another --up that should cause a proper child rekey (or a 2nd /replaced)
IPsec SA - but not a failure.

This shows a few bugs:

1) On initiator, why did we not include a CP request for the IPsec SA rekey ?
2) On receiving CREATE_CHILD_SA without having send a CP request, why do we
   reject a reply with no CP reply?
3) Why does the initiator send multiple proposals? We MUST only use the same
   crypto parameters as the IPsec SA that is currently in use is using. Anything
   else is not allowed.
4) Is the responder and the initiator verifying the chosen proposal is identical
   (other than in theory the CP IP address, but for us it is always the same)
