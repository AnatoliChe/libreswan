Querks when specifying the CKAID of a raw RSA key in a basic IKEv2 connection.

Connections involving rsasigkey are performed using two whack messages
which:

1. add the connection _without_ the raw key
2. add the raw key

This breaks "ipsec auto --add east-ckaid-rsasigkey":

- the first whack message tries to add the connection; since it
  specifies ..ckaid=..., but rsasigkey hasn't yet been added, it fails

But there's a work-around:

1. "ipsec auto --add east-rsasigkey"

   this adds east'ts rsasigkey to the database

2. "ipsec auto --add east-ckaid"

   loads because the command above loaded the RSASIGKEY
