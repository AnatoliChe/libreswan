  <listitem>
<para>how many attempts (a whole number or <emphasis remap='B'>%forever</emphasis>) should be made to
negotiate a connection, or a replacement for one, before giving up
(default
<emphasis remap='B'>%forever</emphasis>).
The value <emphasis remap='B'>%forever</emphasis> or <literal>0</literal> means to keep trying
forever. For Opportunistic Encryption connections, the keyingtries is always set to 1, as the
expiring failureshunt triggers new keyingtries, but only when there is traffic. This prevents
accumulating an infinite amount of attempts to peers that do not support Opportunistic Encryption.
Relevant only locally, other end need not agree on it.</para>
